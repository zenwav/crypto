# Harness Routing — OpenCode

`SKILL.md` routes here when running inside OpenCode. OpenCode's native
skill loader reads from `~/.config/opencode/skills/`,
`~/.opencode/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, and the
project-local equivalents. A single clone into `~/.claude/skills/`
covers BOTH Claude Code AND OpenCode in one step.

## The interview

OpenCode's question-tool surface evolves quickly. Prefer the first of
these that is available in the running session:

1. **OpenCode's built-in question tool** (if exposed by the running
   harness version). Use the same shape as the
   `harnesses/gemini-cli.md` schema — `questions` array with `header`,
   `question`, `type`, `options`.
2. **AUQ (`ask-user-questions-mcp`) plugin** at
   <https://github.com/paulp-o/ask-user-questions-mcp> — install per its
   README, then issue questions via its CLI/MCP tool.
3. **Plain-text fallback** — fall through to `harnesses/generic.md`.

For path 1 or path 2, ask all four required questions (language and variant,
reading level, tone, length) in one call when the source language is
unambiguous. The wording matches `harnesses/claude-code.md`, including detecting
the source language first and building Q1's variant options from
`references/multilingual.md`. Observe the same four-option cap as
`harnesses/claude-code.md`: collapse College and Graduate into one "College or
professional" option (Graduate via inline `level=graduate` or `grade=N`), and
when the language is ambiguous offer the three most likely languages plus "Other
(different language)". Follow `SKILL.md` Step 3's ambiguous-language branch when
detection is uncertain: as in `harnesses/claude-code.md` it takes two calls, a
first call to resolve the language and a second carrying Q1's variants plus the
reading-level, tone, length, and any eligible voice questions.

Only add Q5 when no inline or saved `voice_path` has resolved,
`~/.agentic-humanizer/voice.txt` is absent, and the saved profile does not
contain `"voice_skip": true`. When Q5 is eligible, append this question to
the same call:

```json
{
  "header": "Voice",
  "question": "Mimic a writing sample of yours?",
  "type": "choice",
  "options": [
    { "label": "Yes" },
    { "label": "No" },
    { "label": "Never ask again" }
  ]
}
```

## After the interview

Map the labels to internal variables (same as Claude Code):

- Q1 → `language` and `variant` (read the chosen variant; `Other (different
  language)` is captured next turn and resolved against
  `references/multilingual.md`)
- Q2 → `reading_level` (`College or professional` → `college`; otherwise
  `elementary`/`middle`/`high_school`; for English also set `target_grade`
  4, 7, 10, 13). Graduate (`target_grade` 17) is reachable via inline
  `level=graduate` or `grade=N`, not this question.
- Q3 → `tone`
- Q4 → `length_policy` (`±10`, `exp`, `trim`)
- Q5 → voice choice: `Yes` starts Step 4 sample capture, `No` skips
  voice matching for this call, `Never ask again` persists `voice_skip`.

When Q5 is `Yes`:

1. If Q1 was `Other (different language)`, first capture the language from the
   user's next turn, resolve it and its variant against
   `references/multilingual.md`, and finalize `language` and `variant`. Only
   continue to step 2 after they are resolved.
2. Say exactly: *"Paste 200+ words as your next message."*
3. Capture the next user turn as the voice sample and return to
   `SKILL.md` Step 4 for validation, writing, and fingerprint extraction.

Return to `SKILL.md` § Loop algorithm with these answers.
