# Agentic Humanizer

A 5-pass AI humanizer. It always runs the core rewrite workflow; Slop or Not
Pro adds measured on-device AI detector checks.

- **Without Slop or Not:** runs the full rewrite workflow.
- **With Slop or Not Pro:** adds on-device AI detector scoring, readability, Text Cleanup, and
  cleanup stats.

Supported languages: English, Spanish, German, Italian, Swedish, Danish, and
Norwegian (Bokmal and Nynorsk). The AI detector score is English only; other
languages use native readability and per-language tells. See
`references/multilingual.md`.

**Slash command:** `/agentic-humanizer [paste text]`

**Inline overrides:** `/agentic-humanizer language=<code> variant=<spec> dialect=us|uk grade=N level=<band> tone=casual|professional|academic length=±10|exp|trim threshold=N max=N voice=/path/to/file.txt|off voice-skip skip-interview [paste]`

`language=<code>` and `variant=<spec>` set the target language and variant (for example `language=de variant=de-AT`). `dialect=us|uk` is a legacy English alias: `dialect=us` equals `language=en variant=en-US`, `dialect=uk` equals `language=en variant=en-GB`. `grade=N` sets the Flesch-Kincaid target and is English only; `level=<band>` sets the reading-level band (`elementary|middle|high_school|college|graduate`) for any language. Explicit `language=`/`variant=` win over `dialect=`. Setting `language=` without `variant=` uses that language's default variant from the registry (the first variant listed, or `other:<code>` for an unsupported language with no registry entry). Setting `variant=<tag>` without `language=` infers the base language from the variant's BCP-47 prefix (for example `variant=de-AT` -> `language=de`); if the prefix is unsupported, keep that bare prefix as the language, use the inline variant, and warn. See `references/multilingual.md` for supported codes and variants.

## What this skill does

1. Detects the host harness (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI,
   OpenCode, or generic).
2. Handles profile and voice management commands before any rewrite.
3. Resolves rewrite preferences from inline overrides, saved profile, or the
   harness interview.
4. Optionally resolves a writing sample and extracts a cached stylometric
   fingerprint. Voice matching does not require Slop or Not.
5. Probes whether Slop or Not Pro is reachable via MCP or CLI.
6. Runs the 5-pass humanization workflow:
   - Core mode logs unscored iterations.
   - Slop or Not Pro runs Text Cleanup, detection, and readability checks.
7. Returns the final text, loop history, highest-impact edits, and, when Slop
   cleanup ran, a Text Cleanup summary.

## Step 1: Detect the harness

Identify which harness is running by checking for the harness's distinctive
question tool. Use the first match:

| Harness | Distinctive tool present? | Read this file |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `AskUserQuestion` | `harnesses/claude-code.md` |
| Codex CLI | `tool/requestUserInput` (or `ask_user_question`) | `harnesses/codex.md` |
| Cursor | `AskQuestion` | `harnesses/cursor.md` |
| Gemini CLI | `ask_user` (or equivalent structured-question tool) | `harnesses/gemini-cli.md` |
| OpenCode | OpenCode's built-in `question` tool, or AUQ MCP | `harnesses/opencode.md` |
| Anything else (e.g. ChatGPT Skills) | n/a; fall back to plain text | `harnesses/generic.md` |

Do not load the harness file yet. Save the choice for Step 3.

## Step 2: Profile management commands

The user can manage their saved profile with these subcommands:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/agentic-humanizer show profile` | Print `~/.agentic-humanizer/profile.json` (or "no profile saved"). |
| `/agentic-humanizer reset` | `rm ~/.agentic-humanizer/profile.json` and confirm. |
| `/agentic-humanizer set language=de variant=de-AT level=high_school tone=casual length=±10` | Write a profile from inline params without running the interview. Recognized keys: `language`, `variant`, `dialect` (legacy English alias), `grade` (English only), `level`, `tone`, `length`. Any subset is allowed; missing keys keep their current value or use the default if no profile exists. When `language` changes without an explicit `variant`, reset `variant` to that language's default from `references/multilingual.md` (the first variant listed, or `other:<code>` for an unsupported language) instead of keeping the old one, so the saved pair stays consistent (for example `set language=de` on an English profile writes `variant=de-DE`, not `en-US`). A legacy `dialect=` change without an explicit `variant` resets `variant` to that alias's specific English variant, not the registry default: `dialect=us` writes `variant=en-US` and `dialect=uk` writes `variant=en-GB`. When `variant=<tag>` is given without `language=`, infer the base language from the variant's BCP-47 prefix (for example `set variant=de-AT` -> `language=de`) and update the saved `language` accordingly; if the prefix is unsupported, keep that bare prefix as `language`, keep the inline variant, and warn that the language has no curated support. For English, keep the level fields consistent: `level=` sets `reading_level` and derives `target_grade` from the band midpoint (elementary 4, middle 7, high_school 10, college 13, graduate 17), and `grade=N` sets `target_grade=N` and `reading_level` to that grade's band; when the saved `language` becomes non-English, write `target_grade: null` (the loop reads `reading_level`). |
| `/agentic-humanizer show voice` | Print `~/.agentic-humanizer/voice-fingerprint.json` if present, plus the sample path; otherwise say no voice is saved. |
| `/agentic-humanizer reset voice` | Remove `~/.agentic-humanizer/voice.txt` and `~/.agentic-humanizer/voice-fingerprint.json`, then clear voice fields from the profile without deleting the rewrite preferences. |
| `/agentic-humanizer set voice=/path/to/file.txt` | Save the profile's `voice_path`, clear `voice_skip`, and use that path on future runs. Do not extract the fingerprint until the next rewrite call. |

When you see one of these subcommands, execute it and stop. Do not probe Slop
or run the loop.

## Step 3: Resolve rewrite preferences

**Detect the source language first.** Before reading the profile or running the
interview, detect the language of the pasted text with the host LLM (use the
first ~300 words; no backend needed, so this works in both Core and Slop or Not
Pro modes). Store `detected_language` (a base code such as `de`) and, when the
orthography makes it clear, a `detected_variant_hint` (such as `de-DE`).
Normalize the code per `references/multilingual.md` (Norwegian Bokmal becomes
`nb`, never `no`). If no text has been pasted yet, defer detection until it is.
If the text is under ~20 words or mixed, treat the language as ambiguous.

**Profile resolution order:**

1. **Inline overrides** (`language=`, `variant=`, `dialect=`, `grade=`,
   `level=`, `tone=`, `length=`) -> use them; do not read the profile for the
   overridden keys. Inline `language=`/`variant=` also override detection. When
   `language=` is given without `variant=`, set the variant to that language's
   default from `references/multilingual.md` (the first variant listed), not the
   profile's variant, so the pair stays consistent (for example `language=de`
   alone resolves to `variant=de-DE`; an unsupported language with no registry
   entry, such as `language=fr`, resolves to `variant=other:fr`). When
   `variant=<tag>` is given without `language=`, infer the base language from
   the variant's BCP-47 prefix (for example `variant=de-AT` -> `language=de`,
   `variant=es-419` -> `language=es`); if the prefix is unsupported, keep that
   bare prefix as the language, keep the inline variant, and warn that the
   language has no curated support. If an explicit `language=` is also
   present and conflicts with the variant's base language, `language=` wins and
   the run warns. For English, when `level=` is set without `grade=`, derive
   `target_grade` from the resolved band midpoint (elementary 4, middle 7,
   high_school 10, college 13, graduate 17); an explicit `grade=N` always wins.
   Inline overrides apply per key; resolve any key not supplied inline through
   rules 2 to 4 below rather than leaving it unset.
2. **`skip-interview` flag** -> use the saved profile if present. With no
   profile, keep the detected source language; for the variant, use
   `detected_variant_hint` when it is a valid variant for the resolved language,
   otherwise the resolved language's default variant from
   `references/multilingual.md`. Default the rest (High school, Professional,
   ±10%); fall back to English/en-US only when detection is ambiguous or no text
   was pasted. For English, derive `target_grade` 10 from the High school band.
3. **Saved profile at `~/.agentic-humanizer/profile.json`** present:
   - If `detected_language` equals the profile's `language`, or detection is
     ambiguous, use the profile silently and skip the interview. Never
     re-prompt a user who already has a profile unless they ask.
   - If `detected_language` differs from the profile's `language`
     (unambiguous), the call does not run in the profile's language: an inline
     `language=` wins, otherwise **detection wins**, and inline
     `variant`/`tone`/`length`/`level`/`grade` still override the profile per
     key. Resolve language, variant, reading level, tone, length, and English
     `target_grade` for this case using the decision table in
     `references/profile-resolution.md`. Do not prompt and do not rewrite the
     profile. Carry the table's matching note into Step 7.
4. **No saved profile** -> run the harness interview for any rewrite keys not
   already set by inline overrides (rule 1). With some keys set inline, ask only
   the remaining ones; with none set inline, run the full interview as below.

Read the saved profile with:

```bash
PROFILE=~/.agentic-humanizer/profile.json
[ -f "$PROFILE" ] && cat "$PROFILE"
```

If the file is missing or is malformed JSON, treat it as absent and run the
interview. If it is parseable, first apply the back-compat normalization in the
next paragraph (it maps a legacy `dialect`/`target_grade` profile to
`language`/`variant`/`reading_level`), then judge completeness: only treat the
profile as absent (and run the interview) when it still lacks the resolved
rewrite settings (`language`, `variant`, `reading_level`, `tone`,
`length_policy`) after that mapping. Version 1 and version 2 profiles, which
carry `dialect` and `target_grade` rather than the v3 keys, are complete once
normalized and load without re-prompting. Missing voice fields use their
defaults in Step 4. If a parseable profile has `voice_skip` but is still missing
rewrite keys after normalization, ignore it for the rewrite interview but still
honor `voice_skip` in Step 4.

**Back-compat (read any older profile as v3).** A profile without a `language`
field is English: set `language="en"` and map the legacy `dialect` to `variant`
(`us` -> `en-US`, `uk` -> `en-GB`, `other:<spec>` -> `variant: "other:<spec>"`).
Derive `reading_level` from `target_grade` using the band table in
`references/multilingual.md` (3 to 5 -> `elementary`, 6 to 8 -> `middle`, 9 to
11 -> `high_school`, 12 to 14 -> `college`, 15 and above -> `graduate`; default
`high_school` if `target_grade` is absent). Read every existing field first so
custom values are preserved, then rewrite the whole file as v3 on the next
write. `target_grade` drives termination only for English; for other languages
the loop reads `reading_level` and maps via the registry.

**Run the interview** by reading the harness file selected in Step 1 and
following its interview protocol. The interview stays four rewrite questions (plus a separate language-disambiguation step when detection is ambiguous). The
selected harness may batch the conditional voice question when it is eligible;
Step 4 handles that answer. Capture these rewrite settings here:

- `language` (a base code such as `en`, `de`, `es`, `it`, `sv`, `da`, `nb`,
  `nn`, or other) and `variant` (a BCP-47 tag or `other:<spec>`). Q1 confirms
  the detected language and offers that language's variants from
  `references/multilingual.md`. See "Interview Q1 and Q2" below.
- `reading_level` in {`elementary`, `middle`, `high_school`, `college`,
  `graduate`}. For English also set `target_grade` (the band midpoint: 4, 7,
  10, 13, 17). For other languages the loop reads `reading_level` via the
  registry.
- `tone` in {`casual`, `professional`, `academic`}
- `length_policy` in {`±10`, `exp`, `trim`}

**Interview Q1 and Q2.** Q1 confirms language and variant. When the language was
detected unambiguously, present "Detected <language>. Which variant?" with that
language's variants from `references/multilingual.md` plus "Other (different
language)". When the language is ambiguous or unknown, ask the language first,
then its variant; option-capped harnesses (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI,
OpenCode) offer the three most likely languages plus "Other (different
language)" to stay within their four-option limit, while plain-text and
free-text harnesses (generic, Codex) may list them all. If the user picks
"Other (different language)", capture the language name or code on the next
turn, resolve it against the registry, and warn if it is unsupported (no curated
tells or readability). Q2 covers the five reading-level bands; show each band's
helper text in the resolved language's metric (for example "High school (LIX
about 40 to 50)" for Swedish, "High school (Grade 9 to 11)" for English), drawn
from the registry band table. Option-capped harnesses collapse College and
Graduate into one "College or professional" option to fit the four-option limit,
so Graduate is selected via inline `level=graduate` or `grade=N` there; generic
and Codex keep all five bands. For Norwegian Nynorsk and unsupported languages,
present the bands without a metric helper. Map Q1 to `language` (normalized) and
`variant`; map Q2 to `reading_level` (and `target_grade` for English).

After the rewrite answers, ask **one final yes/no question** (use the same
harness question tool):

> *"Save these as your default so I don't ask again next time? You can reset anytime with `/agentic-humanizer reset`."*

If yes:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agentic-humanizer
cat > ~/.agentic-humanizer/profile.json <<EOF
{
  "language": "<en|de|es|it|sv|da|nb|nn|other>",
  "variant": "<en-US|en-GB|de-DE|de-AT|de-CH|es-ES|es-419|it-IT|sv|da|nb|nn|other:...>",
  "reading_level": "<elementary|middle|high_school|college|graduate>",
  "target_grade": <4|7|10|13|17 for en, else null>,
  "tone": "<casual|professional|academic>",
  "length_policy": "<±10|exp|trim>",
  "voice_path": "~/.agentic-humanizer/voice.txt",
  "voice_skip": false,
  "voice_fingerprint_hash": null,
  "saved_at": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "version": 3
}
EOF
```

`target_grade` is meaningful only when `language` is `en`; write it as `null`
for other languages, where the loop reads `reading_level`. For English, keep
`target_grade` consistent with `reading_level` (the band midpoint), including on
the inline `level=` path.

Then continue to Step 4. Inline overrides on a future call always win over a
saved profile for that one call only; they do not overwrite the file.

## Step 4: Resolve voice sample

Read `references/voice-fingerprint.md` before running this step. Set
`voice_active=false` by default.

**Voice sample resolution order:**

1. Inline `voice=off` or `voice-skip` -> skip voice matching for this call.
2. Inline `voice=/path/to/file.txt` -> use that sample for this call only.
   If the path does not exist or is not readable, warn the user once, then
   fall through to rules 3 onward as if the inline override were absent.
3. Saved `profile.json` has `voice_path` and that file exists -> use it.
4. Default `~/.agentic-humanizer/voice.txt` exists -> use it.
5. Saved `profile.json` has `"voice_skip": true` -> skip silently.
6. Otherwise -> use the conditional Q5 answer already captured by the
   selected harness, or ask it now if the harness did not batch it:

   > *"Mimic a writing sample of yours?"*

   Options: `Yes`, `No`, `Never ask again`.

If Q5 is `No`, skip voice matching for this call. If Q5 is `Never ask again`,
persist `voice_skip` without inventing rewrite preferences, then skip voice
matching. Read any existing profile first:

- A profile already exists (including one just saved in Step 3): rewrite it with
  `"voice_skip": true` and `"version": 3`, preserving its current rewrite keys
  (`language`, `variant`, `reading_level`, `target_grade`, `tone`,
  `length_policy`).
- No profile exists (the user declined to save rewrite defaults in Step 3):
  write a voice-only record holding just `"voice_skip": true` and `"version": 3`,
  with no rewrite keys. Do not fill them from the v3 defaults. Step 3 treats such
  a profile as incomplete for the rewrite interview, so the language, tone, and
  reading-level questions still run next time, while it still honors `voice_skip`
  here.

If Q5 is `Yes`, say exactly:

> *"Paste 200+ words as your next message."*

Capture the next user turn as the sample. Validate it before writing:

- Under 50 words: reject it, say the sample is too short, leave
  `voice_active=false`, and continue without changing the profile.
- 50-199 words: warn that 200+ words works better, then ask whether to
  continue with the shorter sample or paste a longer one.
- 200+ words: write it to `~/.agentic-humanizer/voice.txt`.

For every accepted sample, use only the first 3000 words for fingerprint
extraction. Hash the first 50 KB of the sample content:

```bash
VOICE_SAMPLE="<resolved-sample-path>"
head -c 51200 "$VOICE_SAMPLE" | shasum -a 256
```

Prefix the stored value with `sha256:`.

**Fingerprint cache:**

The cache lives at `~/.agentic-humanizer/voice-fingerprint.json`. Validate it
against every rule in `references/voice-fingerprint.md` Cache invalidation
(file present, `version: 1`, `sample_hash` match, all required fields
populated). On a clean cache hit, use it silently and set
`voice_active=true`. On any invalidation trigger, treat it as a cache miss and
run extraction.

On cache miss, run the extraction prompt from `references/voice-fingerprint.md`
against the host LLM. Render the JSON fingerprint and ask:

> *"Looks right?"*

Options: `Yes`, `Edit`, `Re-extract`.

- `Yes`: write the approved JSON to
  `~/.agentic-humanizer/voice-fingerprint.json`, then rewrite
  `~/.agentic-humanizer/profile.json` so `voice_path` points to the resolved
  sample, `voice_skip` is `false`, `voice_fingerprint_hash` matches the sample
  hash, and `version` is `3`. Use the same heredoc pattern as Step 3, replacing
  only those voice fields and preserving the rewrite preferences (`language`,
  `variant`, `reading_level`, `target_grade`, `tone`, `length_policy`):

  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.agentic-humanizer
  cat > ~/.agentic-humanizer/profile.json <<EOF
  {
    "language": "<keep current>",
    "variant": "<keep current>",
    "reading_level": "<keep current>",
    "target_grade": <keep current>,
    "tone": "<keep current>",
    "length_policy": "<keep current>",
    "voice_path": "<resolved-sample-path>",
    "voice_skip": false,
    "voice_fingerprint_hash": "sha256:<current-sample-hash>",
    "saved_at": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
    "version": 3
  }
  EOF
  ```

  Then set `voice_active=true`.
- `Edit`: let the user correct the JSON inline. Validate it against the
  required-field list in `references/voice-fingerprint.md` Required fields
  before saving. If the edit drops a required field, refuse to save and offer
  Re-extract.
- `Re-extract`: ask what to change, then re-run extraction with that hint.

On harnesses without a structured-question tool (the `generic` fallback), the
approval gate degrades to print-and-continue. See `harnesses/generic.md`
Fingerprint approval.

Inline `voice=/path/to/file.txt` does not overwrite the default sample or
saved profile path. It may refresh the shared fingerprint cache for that
sample hash.

If extraction fails, if the sample is binary or unreadable, or if no host LLM
is available for the extraction prompt, set `voice_active=false`, add the
extraction-failure footer flag for Step 7, and continue without voice
matching.

## Step 5: Probe Slop or Not Pro

Set `slop_mode="llm-only"` and `slop_backend=null` by default. Probing Slop
selects the enhancement path only; it never decides whether the humanizer runs.

Run a real `detect_text` fixture call to verify both presence AND Pro tier.
`slop status` succeeds for non-Pro; only `detect_text` Pro-gates.

Use this fixture for both paths:

```text
In today's digital environment, organizations often adopt new software because it promises efficiency, but the real value depends on whether people can trust it. A useful tool should explain what it does, respect the user's context, and avoid turning simple decisions into complicated workflows. Clear documentation helps teams evaluate those tradeoffs before they commit time or money.
```

**MCP path (try first):**

Call `mcp__SlopOrNot__detect_text` with the fixture and
`include_readability: true`. If the tool call succeeds and the parsed response
has a numeric `score` or `ai_probability` field, set
`slop_mode="slop-or-not-pro"` and `slop_backend="mcp"`. Treat scores from
`score` and `ai_probability` as 0-1 decimals unless the value is already
greater than 1. For readability, read the Flesch-Kincaid grade from
`readability.scores[]` where `kind` is `fleschKincaidGradeLevel`.

**CLI path (try second):**

Run via Bash with the app-bundle binary:

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | "/Applications/Slop Or Not.app/Contents/MacOS/slop" text --json
In today's digital environment, organizations often adopt new software because it promises efficiency, but the real value depends on whether people can trust it. A useful tool should explain what it does, respect the user's context, and avoid turning simple decisions into complicated workflows. Clear documentation helps teams evaluate those tradeoffs before they commit time or money.
EOF
```

If exit code is 0 AND stdout parses as JSON with one of these numeric score
paths, set `slop_mode="slop-or-not-pro"` and `slop_backend="cli"`:

- `detection.result._0`
- `detection.resultFewSentences._0`
- `ai_probability`

For CLI readability, read the grade from `readability.scores[]` where `kind` is
`fleschKincaidGradeLevel`. The detection score (`detection.result._0`) is a 0-1
decimal: multiply by 100 for a percentage unless the value exceeds 1. Readability
grades are never percentages.

The probe fixture above is English, so its readability block always returns
`kind: fleschKincaidGradeLevel`. This call only proves Pro access; discard its
readability value. Source-language readability is measured separately on the
real source text in Step 6, where the returned `kind` depends on the source
language (see `references/multilingual.md`).

If neither path is live, keep `slop_mode="llm-only"` and continue to Step 6.
Do not skip the interview, voice matching, or rewrite loop.

## Step 6: Run the loop

Use the language L resolved in Step 3 (which already applies, in precedence
order, any inline `language=`, the base language inferred from a `variant=`-only
override, the detected and confirmed language, and the saved profile). If L is not English, read
`references/multilingual.md` (the registry: readability formulas, band mapping,
code normalization). Read `references/per-iteration-strategies.md` (the
per-iteration cookbook). Then load the tell catalogue for L's branch below. The
language branch composes with, and does not replace, the 5-iteration schedule.

**Preserve coverage.** Rewrite, don't delete: keep every fact and section the
source covers and preserve the core meaning. Removing an AI tell never means
dropping content. Under `length_policy=trim`, cut only redundancy, filler, and
restated points, never a unique fact or a whole section; shorten a fact's
phrasing rather than removing it. Length changes come only from the resolved
`length_policy`, never from silent omission.

### Language branch: loading and termination

**L is `en` (English).** Read `references/patterns.md` (the canonical 33-pattern
rewrite vocabulary), `references/supplemental-ai-tells.md`, and
`references/detection-guidance.md` (a false-positive guard: what not to flag and
which human-writing signals to preserve). Use the full
detector path. Read the Flesch-Kincaid grade from `scores[]` where `kind` is
`fleschKincaidGradeLevel`. If `target_grade` is null or unset here (for example
inherited from a non-English saved profile through a partial inline override),
derive it from the resolved `reading_level` band midpoint (elementary 4, middle
7, high_school 10, college 13, graduate 17) before the termination check; an
explicit inline `grade=` always wins. Terminate per "Termination with Slop or
Not Pro" below.

**L is `es`, `de`, `it`, `sv`, `da`, or `nb` (supported non-English).** Do NOT
read `references/patterns.md` (it is English vocabulary). Read
`references/supplemental-ai-tells.md` and the per-language tell file
`references/ai-tells/<L>.md` (Norwegian Bokmal uses `references/ai-tells/no.md`,
Bokmal section). Pass the normalized `language_code` on every Slop or Not call.
Read whatever score `kind` `scores[]` returns, label it by that `kind`, and map
the value to a band using `references/multilingual.md`. The AI score is `n/a`:
`detect_text` returns `kind: "not_english"` with `score: null` for non-English
input, so do not call it for readability convergence. Get readability under Slop
or Not Pro with a single `analyze_readability` call; do not also call
`detect_text`. Terminate on readability band membership (per-scale semantics in
the registry) or after MAX_ITER; there is no AI threshold check.

**L is `nn` (Norwegian Nynorsk).** Do NOT read `references/patterns.md`. Read
`references/supplemental-ai-tells.md` and `references/ai-tells/no.md`, Nynorsk
section. Readability is not available (the app returns `unsupported_language`),
so skip `analyze_readability`. The AI score is `n/a`. Run all MAX_ITER
iterations and select the final iteration by quality (same as Core mode). Warn
the user: "Readability scoring is not available for Norwegian Nynorsk in this
app version."

**L is an unsupported language.** Do NOT read `references/patterns.md`. Read
`references/supplemental-ai-tells.md` only. The AI score is `n/a`. Do not call
`detect_text`. Call `analyze_readability` with the normalized `language_code`;
if `scores[]` returns a known kind, log the value as advisory only and never use
it for termination; if `scores[]` is empty, treat readability as unavailable.
Run all MAX_ITER iterations and select the final iteration by quality (same as
Core mode). Follow the unsupported-language policy in
`references/multilingual.md`.

When `voice_active=true`, Iteration 2 and Iteration 5 consume the cached
fingerprint using the contracts in `references/per-iteration-strategies.md`.
No other iteration uses the voice fingerprint.

Constants (overridable via inline params when Slop or Not Pro is available):

- `AI_THRESHOLD = 40` (override: `threshold=N`)
- `MAX_ITER = 5` (override: `max=N`)
- Grade tolerance: ±1

### Slop or Not Pro setup

If `slop_mode="slop-or-not-pro"`, run Text Cleanup on the source before
Iteration 0. Store:

- `source_cleaned_text`
- `source_cleanup_stats`

Use `source_cleaned_text` as the Iteration 0 baseline. Score and analyze the
cleaned source, not the raw source.

### Core setup

If `slop_mode="llm-only"`, use the original source as Iteration 0. Do not
call `detect_text`, `analyze_readability`, or `clean_text`.

### Cleanup stats parsing

For MCP `clean_text`, decode `content[0].text` as JSON before reading:

- `cleaned_text`
- `removed_invisibles`
- `punctuation_replacements`
- `homoglyphs_replaced`
- `british_substitutions`

For CLI cleanup, pipe the selected text into the app-bundle binary:

```bash
cat <<'TEXT_TO_CLEAN' | "/Applications/Slop Or Not.app/Contents/MacOS/slop" cleanup --json
<selected source or final text>
TEXT_TO_CLEAN
```

Then read:

- `cleanedText`
- Sum `invisibleCounts[].count`
- Sum `punctuationCounts[].count`
- Sum `homoglyphCounts[].count`
- Count `britishMappings.length`

Normalize those into this internal shape:

```json
{
  "invisibles": 0,
  "punctuation": 0,
  "homoglyphs": 0,
  "dialect_substitutions": 0
}
```

### Termination with Slop or Not Pro

**English (L is `en`):** AI score <= `AI_THRESHOLD` AND the reading-level grade
test passes, or after `MAX_ITER`. The grade test depends on how the Graduate
target was set. For elementary through college, the test is always
`|grade - target_grade| <= 1`. For the Graduate band: when Graduate was selected
as a band (via `level=graduate` or the interview, with `target_grade` derived as
17), replace the grade test with range membership `grade >= 15` (the FK lower
edge), so a College-level grade of 14 cannot satisfy a Graduate target; when an
explicit inline `grade=N` was given (English only), keep the symmetric
`|grade - target_grade| <= 1` tolerance regardless of the derived band, so the
explicit target is honored. This conditional applies only to English FK; German
Wiener `level=graduate` always uses range membership (no explicit numeric grade
there). On non-convergence, return the best iteration: lowest score that meets
the grade test; if none meet the grade test, lowest score outright. Do not select an
iteration that dropped a source fact or section to lower the score; the Preserve
coverage rule above governs the final choice.

**Supported non-English (L in {es, de, it, sv, da, nb}):** no AI threshold (the
AI score is `n/a`). Terminate when the readability score for L's formula lands
in the target band (grade scales use `|score - band_midpoint| <= 1`, except the
open-ended Graduate band, which uses range membership so a College-level score
cannot satisfy a Graduate target; ease scales and LIX use band-range membership;
see `references/multilingual.md`) or after `MAX_ITER`. On non-convergence, return
the iteration closest to the target band.

**Nynorsk (L is `nn`):** tells-only, no readability and no AI score. Run all
`MAX_ITER` iterations and select by quality, as in Core mode.

**Unsupported language (L is other):** tells-only with no AI score. Run all
`MAX_ITER` iterations and select by quality, as in Core mode. If
`analyze_readability` returns a known score, log it as advisory only; never
terminate or select the final iteration based on that advisory score.

After selecting the final iteration, run Text Cleanup on that selected text.
Store `final_cleanup_stats` and use the cleaned text as the final output. Then
run the final scoring pass gated by L, matching the loop's per-language rule:
for English, run final `detect_text` and `analyze_readability`; for supported
non-English (es, de, it, sv, da, nb), run final `analyze_readability` only (skip
`detect_text`, which returns `not_english` with a null score); for Nynorsk, skip
both; for an unsupported language, run final `analyze_readability` only and log
any known score as advisory (the AI score is `n/a`).

### Completion in Core mode

Run all five rewrite strategies once unless the source is empty or unusable.
Log AI score and readability as `null` for every iteration. Select the final
iteration by rewrite quality: preserve meaning and the source's fact and section coverage, honor the requested reading
level, tone, and length, and remove the most visible AI tells from the tell
files loaded for L's branch (for English, `references/patterns.md` plus
`references/supplemental-ai-tells.md`; for a supported non-English language,
`references/supplemental-ai-tells.md` plus `references/ai-tells/<L>.md`, where
Norwegian Bokmal and Nynorsk both use `references/ai-tells/no.md`; for an
unsupported language, `references/supplemental-ai-tells.md` alone, since no
per-language tell file exists).

### Mid-flight Pro-gate

If any `detect_text`, `analyze_readability`, or `clean_text` call returns
`isError: true` (MCP) or non-zero exit (CLI) on iteration >= 1, fall through
to Core mode for the remaining iterations. See
`references/per-iteration-strategies.md` Mid-flight Pro-gate fallback.

## Step 7: Output

Render this canonical block. The example shows English; the Language line and
the readability column adapt to the resolved language (see the rules below the
block).

```markdown
## Humanized text
<final text>

## Language
English (en-US). Readability: Flesch-Kincaid grade.

## Loop history
| Iter | AI score | Readability | Strategy |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | 92% | 11.4 (College) | baseline |
| 1 | 71% | 10.8 (High school) | pattern surgery |
| 2 | 48% | 10.4 (High school) | variant + tone |
| 3 | 27% | 9.7 (High school) | grade gap |
Converged at iter 3 (<=40% AI, grade target 9 to 11).

## Text Cleanup summary
| Stage | Invisibles | Punctuation | Homoglyphs | Dialect substitutions |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Source cleanup | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| Final cleanup | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

## Highest-impact edits
- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>
- <bullet 3 (optional)>
```

**Language line.** Always show the resolved language and variant, plus the
readability formula's display name from `references/multilingual.md`, for example
"German (de-DE). Readability: Wiener Sachtextformel." For Norwegian Nynorsk
(`nn`), render readability as unavailable, for example "Norwegian Nynorsk (nn).
Readability: not available." For an unsupported language, render readability as
advisory when `analyze_readability` returned a known kind, for example "French
(fr-CA). Readability: advisory Flesch-Szigriszt."; otherwise render it as not
available.
When detection overrode a saved profile language, mark it and add the note, for
example "German (de-DE, detected; saved profile language is English).
Readability: Wiener Sachtextformel." followed by:

```markdown
> _Ran in German because the text was detected as German; your saved profile language is English. Override with `language=` to change._
```

When an inline `language=` or variant-inferred language overrode a saved profile
language, mark that source instead of saying detection chose the language. Use
the wording from `references/profile-resolution.md`, for example:

```markdown
> _Ran in French because `language=fr` was set for this call; your saved profile language is English._
```

**Readability column.** The formula is named once in the Language line (use its
display name from `references/multilingual.md`). In the loop-history column show
only the value and the band in parentheses, for example "10.6 (High school)".
For unsupported-language advisory readability, show only the value and
"(advisory)", since there is no target band.

**AI score column (non-English).** Render "n/a (detector is English-only)" on
the first row and "n/a" thereafter. In Core mode, render "n/a" for every row.

**Convergence line (non-English with readability).** Reference the band, not the
AI threshold, for example "Converged at iter 3 (readability in target band: High
school)." For Nynorsk, or an unsupported language with no advisory readability
score, use "Completed MAX_ITER iterations (no readability available for this
language; selected by quality)." For an unsupported language with an advisory
readability score, use "Completed MAX_ITER iterations (readability advisory only
for this language; selected by quality)."

Show `Text Cleanup summary` only when real Slop or Not Text Cleanup ran. Do
not show backend names in the user-facing output.

If every cleanup count is zero, replace the table with:

```markdown
## Text Cleanup summary
Slop or Not found no hidden characters, punctuation artifacts, homoglyphs, or dialect substitutions to clean.
```

When Slop or Not Pro does not converge (English), replace the convergence line
with:

```markdown
Did not converge below threshold in MAX_ITER iterations. Best result shown above
(iter N at S%). Re-run with `threshold=40 max=8` for a more aggressive loop,
or `tone=casual` if professional tone is constraining the rewrite.
```

For non-English non-convergence, replace the convergence line with:

```markdown
Did not reach the target band in MAX_ITER iterations. Closest result shown above (iter N, <formula>: X.X). Re-run with a different `level=` to widen the target.
```

When Slop or Not Pro is unavailable, render score and grade as `n/a` and add
this note after the history table:

```markdown
> _Ran without Slop or Not Pro. Add Slop or Not Pro for on-device AI detector scoring, readability checks, Text Cleanup, and cleanup stats: <https://slopornot.ai/download>_
```

For mid-flight Core-mode fallback iterations, render score and grade as `n/a`
and add this note:

```markdown
> _Iterations N-M ran without on-device scoring. Local stats are unavailable for those iterations._
```

If voice matching was active, add this footer note:

```markdown
> _Voice matched from <path> (fingerprint cached <date>)._
```

If voice extraction failed in Step 4, add this footer note instead:

```markdown
> _Voice extraction failed; ran without voice match. Re-run with `/agentic-humanizer reset voice` to retry._
```
